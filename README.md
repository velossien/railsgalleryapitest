## A dockerized API-only Rails app that acts as the backend for a React powered test Image Gallery ([here](https://github.com/velossien/reactgallerytest)).  

### This is a Work-In-Progress

This is my second attempt to create a Rails backend for an image gallery. My first attempt was [here](https://github.com/velossien/railsgallerytest).  I switched from that full Ruby on Rails app to this API-only app once I realized what my project really needed (and that I could make an API-only Rails app).  This app is dockerized, contains seed data (currently Nicholas Cage images) and runs a PostgreSQL database to hold the images url and data.  

Once I have all the CRUD operations working smoothly, I will transfer the knowledge of what I learned from this project to my current React powered image gallery projects ([here](https://github.com/velossien/photo-gallery) and [here](https://github.com/velossien/FolejoDePuertoNuevo)).
